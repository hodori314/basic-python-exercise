## Implementing Data Structure

### Deque
- difficulty: ★☆☆  
- time: ~ 1h 30m for beginners
- background: list(e.g., slicing, ...), iteration(e.g., for, while), contitional(e.g., if-elif-else)

Implement doubly ended queue(Dequeue) <a href='https://docs.python.org/ko/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque'>[official doc]</a> <a href='https://github.com/hodori314/basic-python-exercise/blob/main/deque.py'>[code]</a>    
You have to cover `append`, `appendleft`, `pop`, `popleft`, `index`, `insert`, `remove`, `count` functions.  
Behaviors of those functions you have to implement are the same as the description of the official document.  

### Counter
- difficulty: ★☆☆  
- time: ~ 1h for beginners
- background: list, iteration(e.g., for, while), contitional(e.g., if-elif-else)

Implement Counter <a href='https://docs.python.org/ko/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter'>[official doc]</a> <a href='https://github.com/hodori314/basic-python-exercise/blob/main/counter.py'>[code]</a>   
You have to cover `most_common`, `total`, `elements` functions.  
Behaviors of those functions you have to implement are the same as the description of the official document.  

## Dealing with concepts of OOP

You have to cover  `__init__`, `most_common`, `total`, `elements` functions.  
Behaviors of those functions you have to implement are the same as the description of the official document.
